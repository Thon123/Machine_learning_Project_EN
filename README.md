# Machine_learning_Project_EN
Machine learning projects from beginner to advanced level.

This repository will be filled with machine learning projects created in Jupyter Notebook.
It is on any kind of tutorial, i am just boosting my knowledge and skills. So please don't
take these material for granted. I will do a lot of mistakes and sometimes i won't :), but 
it could be a great source for starting learners, for comparison, inspiration etc.

*Note: i am fitting the model also on test set - i have to only transform and predit with best model - change*
