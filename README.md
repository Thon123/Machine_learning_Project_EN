# Machine_learning_Project_EN
Machine learning projects from beginner to advanced level. Over time I will be adding more and more projects.

Contains:
- Iris data set - short and easy introduction to ML - using Pandas, Numpy, Scikit, Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Loan prediction - mindly advanced and significantly longer - using Pandas, Numpy, Scikit, Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Big Mart Sales - even a little better than previous project - 187th of 4000 on analyticsvydhia, but still a lot to improve!
- PySpark intro - a set of micro projects from PySpark course I have taken, some parts are written by me some are from Course,
mainly a handy functions for data preparation (it would be waste of time to write by myself :)). Bottom Line: PySpark is very similar
to Pandas-Scikit but capable managing big data and less flexible.
- TensorFlow intro: contains mainly theory and code about ANN, CNNs, RNNs (GRU, LSTM), Reinforcment Learning (not done yet)
