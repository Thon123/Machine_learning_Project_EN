# Machine_learning_Project_EN
Machine learning projects from beginner to advanced level.

This repository would be filled with machine learning projects created in Jupyter Notebook.
It will be my own work as a "noobie" machine learner who does that for fun. So please don't
take these material for granted. I will do a lot fo mistakes and sometimes i won't :), but 
it could be a great source for starting learnes, for comparison and so on. 

If someone will ever read it :).
