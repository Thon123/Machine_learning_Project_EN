# Machine_learning_Project_EN
Machine learning projects from beginner to advanced level. Over time I will be adding more and more projects.

Contains:
- **Iris Data set** - first project done by myself, So I am having it here just out of sentiment :)
- **Loan prediction** - mindly advanced and significantly longer - using Pandas, Numpy, Scikit, Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **Big Mart Sales** - even a little better than previous project - 187th of 4000 on analyticsvydhia, but still a lot to improve!
- **PySpark intro** - a set of micro projects from PySpark course I have taken, some parts are written by me some are from course,
mainly a handy functions for data preparation.
- **TensorFlow intro** - contains theory and code about ANN, CNNs, RNNs (GRU, LSTM) and Reinforcment Learning (not done yet). Main sources of information are: TF2 course by LP, Hands-On Machine...and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron and Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng.
- **Feature Engineering Tips & Tricks** - contains feature operations I've found interesting (will be added soon)
- **Trading/Stocks** - future project
