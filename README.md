# Machine_learning_Project_EN
Machine learning projects from beginner to advanced level. Over time I will be adding more projects.

Contains:
1. Iris data set - short and easy introduction to ML - using Pandas, Numpy, Scikit, Matplotlib and Seaborn
2. Loan prediction - mindly advanced and significantly longer - using Pandas, Numpy, Scikit, Matplotlib and Seaborn
3. Big Mart Sales - even a little better than previous project - 187th of 4000 on analyticsvydhia, IMPROVE

What to improve in next project: 
A. metric score on test/train
B. starting with fast ML algorithm and with feature selection => and proceed with that
C. using polynomial features
